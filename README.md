# CampusOne
CampusOne is a modern web app for schools and universities. Users can register as students or teachers, log in, and manage tasks. Only teachers can add new tasks; both roles can view and delete them. The app uses a dark theme, integrates with a REST API and MongoDB, and features a responsive interface.

## Main features:
- User registration and login (student or teacher)
- Role-based access for task management
- Task list with title, description, and deadline
- Modern dark UI and responsive design
